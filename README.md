# OpenMM-PSF
#This notebook can be divided to three parts.
1. Openmm installation and a test simulation
2. Openmm simulation with Amber input, i.e., a prmtop file, and a (inp)crd file
3. Openmm simulation with VMD/Charmm input, i.e., a psf file and a pdb file.

Note: The method of how to generate Amber or VMD/Charmm input is not incluede here, you are supposed to be confident with at least one of them before using this notebook.

## Note, the 3htb, example, i.e., the first OpenMM simulation is just for testing purpose, to verify our simulation software (openmm) is working. For a more proper simulation you should use the following two, i.e., the Amber input version or the VMD/Charmm input verion.
